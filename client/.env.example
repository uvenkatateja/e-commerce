# Vite Environment Variables
# In Vite, all environment variables MUST start with VITE_

# For local development, this is optional.
# If omitted, the app will default to http://localhost:5000/api
# Uncomment the line below if your backend is running on a different port.

# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For PRODUCTION (Vercel):
# You DO NOT use this file.
# Instead, go to your Vercel Project Settings -> Environment Variables
# and add VITE_API_URL pointing to your live backend:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api
